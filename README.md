# CX SDD Framework

A comprehensive **role-based agentic framework** for **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** that provides GitHub Copilot with structured instructions for disciplined, specification-first development across multiple technology stacks.

## What is Spec-Driven Development (SDD)?

Spec-Driven Development is a methodology where software development is guided by clear, executable specifications that serve as the single source of truth for project requirements, behaviors, and implementations.

### Core Principles

- **Specification First**: Before any code is written, create detailed specifications that define exactly what needs to be built
- **Role-Based Expertise**: AI agents operate within defined roles (Solution Architect, Business Analyst, Developer, QA, DevOps, Technical Writer) to ensure appropriate expertise and boundaries
- **Anti-Assumption Protocols**: Agents never add unrequested features or make silent assumptions - they ask for clarification explicitly
- **Traceability**: Every feature implementation can be traced back to its originating specification with requirement IDs
- **Deterministic Implementation**: When users agree to specific proposals, agents implement exactly what was agreed upon

## Why Use This Framework?

### Traditional AI Agent Challenges
- Agents make assumptions and add unrequested features
- Inconsistent behavior across different types of work
- No clear expertise boundaries or escalation paths
- Implementation differs from what was proposed/agreed upon
- Lack of requirement traceability

### SDD Framework Solutions
- **Clear Role Boundaries**: Each agent operates within defined expertise domains with clear responsibilities
- **Explicit Communication**: Agents state assumptions clearly and ask for clarification when uncertain
- **Anti-Assumption Protocols**: Strict rules preventing agents from adding unrequested functionality
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Agents implement exactly what was proposed and agreed upon
- **Escalation Authority**: Solution Architect role can resolve conflicts and make architectural decisions

## How the Framework Works

### Available Roles

The framework provides **7 industry-standard roles** that GitHub Copilot can assume:

| Role | Expertise | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Solution Architect** | System architecture, cross-role coordination | Escalation authority, conflict resolution, architectural decisions |
| **Software Architect** | Technical design, API design | System structure, technology choices, design patterns |
| **Business Analyst** | Requirements analysis | Functional specifications, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| **Software Developer** | Implementation | Code writing, unit testing, requirement traceability |
| **QA Engineer** | Quality assurance, testing | Test planning, validation, quality gates |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Infrastructure, deployment | CI/CD, monitoring, operational requirements |
| **Technical Writer** | Documentation | User guides, API docs, process documentation |

### Role Selection Process

1. **User makes request** ‚Üí Copilot analyzes the request
2. **Copilot proposes role** ‚Üí "This appears to be a [ROLE] task. Should I proceed with [ROLE] instructions?"
3. **User confirms** ‚Üí Copilot loads role-specific instructions and operates within that role's boundaries
4. **Role switching** ‚Üí Available if request changes scope or different expertise is needed

### Framework Benefits

- üéØ **Focused Expertise**: Each role provides specialized knowledge and appropriate boundaries
- ÔøΩ **Anti-Assumption Protocols**: Prevents agents from adding unrequested features or making silent assumptions  
- ÔøΩ **Deterministic Implementation**: Ensures agents implement exactly what was proposed and agreed upon
- ÔøΩ **Requirement Traceability**: Every change links back to specific requirements with IDs
- ‚ö° **Escalation Authority**: Solution Architect can resolve conflicts and override constraints when necessary

1. **Copy the framework files** to your repository:
   ```bash
   # Copy the entire .github directory to your project
   cp -r .github/ /path/to/your/project/
   ```

2. **Start a conversation with GitHub Copilot**:
   ```
   "I need to add user authentication to my application"
   ```

3. **Copilot will propose a role**:
   ```
   "This appears to be a Software Developer task. Should I proceed with Software Developer instructions?"
   ```

4. **Confirm and begin**:
   ```
   "Yes, proceed"
   ```

5. **Copilot operates within role boundaries**, following SDD principles and asking for specifications

## Core Framework Principles

### 1. Spec-First Development
- ‚úÖ **Verify spec status before coding**
- ‚úÖ **Reference specific requirement IDs in all work**
- ‚ùå **No implementation without approved specifications**

### 2. Explicit Communication  
- ‚úÖ **State assumptions clearly**
- ‚úÖ **Ask for clarification when uncertainty > 10%**
- ‚ùå **Never silently infer critical details**

### 3. Anti-Assumption Practices
- ‚úÖ **Stick to what was explicitly requested**
- ‚úÖ **Label additions as suggestions**: "You didn't ask for this, but would you like me to suggest..."
- ‚ùå **Adding "helpful" features not requested**
- ‚ùå **Assuming technology preferences beyond what's stated**

### 4. Deterministic Implementation
- ‚úÖ **When user agrees to a proposal, implement EXACTLY what was proposed**
- ‚úÖ **Copy exact text from proposals when implementing**
- ‚ùå **Never regenerate or "improve" upon agreed content**

### 5. Role Boundaries
- ‚úÖ **Stay within your role's defined responsibilities**
- ‚úÖ **Escalate to Solution Architect for cross-role conflicts**
- ‚úÖ **Respect other roles' expertise domains**

## Example Interactions

### Business Analyst Role
```
User: "I need user authentication functionality"

BA: "I'll help create the functional specification for user authentication. 
     What authentication methods do you require? (email/password, OAuth, 2FA?)
     What are the security requirements?
     Should I create user stories with acceptance criteria?"
```

### Software Developer Role  
```
User: "Implement the login function"

Dev: "I need the approved specification for the login functionality. 
     Could you provide:
     ‚Ä¢ The specification document path
     ‚Ä¢ Specific requirement ID to implement
     ‚Ä¢ Current specification status (should be 'Approved')"
```

### Solution Architect Role (Escalation)
```
Dev: "I'm getting conflicting requirements between the API spec and UI mockups"

SA: "I'll analyze this conflict. Let me review both specifications and 
    make an architectural decision. I'll document the resolution and 
    update the affected specifications accordingly."
```
